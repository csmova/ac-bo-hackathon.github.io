This tutorial will focus on developing the ask/tell interfaces necessary for human-in-the-loop experimentation. We will use real-world data from wet-lab voltammetry experiments for demonstration. We will first detail a simple use case in scikit-optimize package. Then, we will move to the Ax package, which offers additional capabilities for advanced users. We hope this tutorial will streamline the dry-lab set up for experimentalists that are using Bayesian optimization in an 'ask/tell' fashion in their laboratory.
